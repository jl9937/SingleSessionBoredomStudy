Now travelling to the International Space Station!!!

This is it Commander! You've done such a good job sorting out all those messes on Earth that you're being sent into space! 

The ISS has a bit of a spacesuit problem, and they need you to patch things up. Now, don't let the lack of gravity fool you, this is still a weighty mission. 

Just remember, yellow left, blue right, and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is not airtight!
