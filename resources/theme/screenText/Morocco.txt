Now travelling to Moroccan Market! 

Good morning Commander. I hope you don't mind the heat, because I've just received an emergency telegram from the Moraccan government. Apparently one of their biggest markets has gone into organisational meltdown, and they want you to help get things back into order!

I know you know what to do, but it's my job to say: yellow left, blue right, and try to avoid sorting anything the sensors say is mouldy!
